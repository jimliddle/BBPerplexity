# BBPerplexity
This Is a single page web page implementation of perplexity for the blackberry passport OS 10. It may run on other OS10 devices but it has not been checked. You will need a perplexity API key to be able to use this. All you need to do is to copy the html file to your local device and run it in the default blackberry passport browser. It works with citations as you would expect and is a full implementation of working with the perplexity api in the legacy blackberry default web browser.
